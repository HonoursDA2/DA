        <div class="content"><h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease , with over 350 million people currently estimated to have the disease
worldwide. Statistics state that about 78% remain undiagnosed in Africa alone. This can
be attributed to: a lack of awareness, low literacy levels as well as the high cost and limited availability
of medical professionals. Diabetes is not a well known disease amongst the communities
of the undeveloped world. Thus, the consequences and complications brought by the disease are
unknown to a large portion of Diabetes sufferers. As a result of this, there are a lot of people experiencing
the symptoms that come with the onset of Diabetes, yet still living a lifestyle that only
worsens the condition. In Africa alone there are about 344,000 deaths a year due to Diabetes
and Diabetes related complications.</p><br><p>
The proposed solution to this problem is a prototype web-based Expert System that offers an
interactive risk assessment facility as well as advice on Diabetes management and treatment. The
user interacts with the system by answering a series of questions dynamically posed by the expert
system as well as giving input of their currently experienced symptoms. The Expert System provides
comprehensive feedback throughout the assessment to keep the user involved, followed by a
percentage diagnosis of the user's chances of having developed Diabetes.</p>

        <div class="content"><h1>Diabetes</h1>
     <p>Diabetes Mellitus, more commonly known as Diabetes, describes a group of metabolic noncommunicable1
diseases in which a person has a high count of blood glucose (sugar) in their
body. This occurs mainly because of the following two reasons:
<ol>
<li>The body does not produce enough insulin.</li>
<li>The cells in the body do not react appropriately to the insulin. </li>
</ol>
<br>
Insulin is a hormone produced and secreted naturally within the pancreas that is used to control
the amount of glucose in the blood. The normal production of insulin allows muscles and other
tissue within the body to take glucose from the blood and convert it into energy. Administering
insulin to a diabetic does not cure the Diabetes. However, it does make living with the disease a lot
more manageable in the long term. Before the discovery of insulin in the early in the 20th century,
Diabetes was a greatly feared disease with diabetics quickly succumbing to their death without
even the slightest hope of prolonged survival.
There are two distinct types of Diabetes, along with Gestational Diabetes. Pre-diabetes is the
term given to the condition in people with high glucose levels that are not high enough to indicate
Diabetes.</p><br>
<h2> Type 1</h2>
<p>Often referred to as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes describes the condition
where the body does not produce insulin. It is mostly seen in children and young adults. Type1
Diabetes accounts for about 5% to 10% of all diagnosed cases of Diabetes.</p><br>
<h2> Type 2</h2>
<p>In Type 2 Diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin for proper everyday functioning
or the cells do not react properly to the insulin. Type2 Diabetes is the most common variety of
diabetes in the world as it accounts for about 90%-95% of all types of diabetes.</p><br>
<h2> Gestational Diabetes</h2>
    <p>This occurs in about 2%-10% of all pregnancies making it one of the most common health problems
associated with pregnancy. When a woman is pregnant the hormonal changes occurring
within the body can make the cells less responsive to insulin. In most cases it disappears when
the pregnancy is over, with a small percentage of woman eventually being diagnosed with Type 2
Diabetes after the pregnancy period. It shares many similarities to Type 2 Diabetes.</p>

                 The Expert System aims to closely imitate the interaction
                a patient would have with a doctor during a converstation. In order to achieve this a Doctor was worked with throughout the development phase of the application. A strict process of Knowledge Engineering The Expert System focuses on the following three areas with the patient: 
                                <ul>
                <li>Demography and general information.</li>
