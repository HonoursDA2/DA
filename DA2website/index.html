        <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease , with over 350 million people currently estimated to have the disease
worldwide. Statistics state that about 78% remain undiagnosed in Africa alone. This can
be attributed to: a lack of awareness, low literacy levels as well as the high cost and limited availability
of medical professionals. Diabetes is not a well known disease amongst the communities
of the undeveloped world. Thus, the consequences and complications brought by the disease are
unknown to a large portion of Diabetes sufferers. As a result of this, there are a lot of people experiencing
the symptoms that come with the onset of Diabetes, yet still living a lifestyle that only
worsens the condition. In Africa alone there are about 344,000 deaths a year due to Diabetes
and Diabetes related complications.</p><br><p>
The proposed solution to this problem is a prototype web-based Expert System that offers an
interactive risk assessment facility as well as advice on Diabetes management and treatment. The
user interacts with the system by answering a series of questions dynamically posed by the expert
system as well as giving input of their currently experienced symptoms. The Expert System provides
comprehensive feedback throughout the assessment to keep the user involved, followed by a
percentage diagnosis of the user's chances of having developed Diabetes.

The intented objectives of this system are:
<ul>
    <li> To give users a realizstic estimate of their chances of developing Diabetes.</li>
    <li> To give users comprehenisve information on Diabetes.</li>
    <li> To provde users with an easy to use, interactive User Interface. That is able to cater for users of all literacy levels.</li>

             <p>Diabetes Mellitus, more commonly known as Diabetes, describes a group of metabolic noncommunicable
        diseases in which a person has a high count of blood glucose (sugar) in their
        body. This occurs mainly because of the following two reasons:
        <lb>
        <ol>
            <li>The body does not produce enough insulin.</li>
            <li>The cells in the body do not react appropriately to the insulin. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Insulin is a hormone produced and secreted naturally within the pancreas that is used to control
        the amount of glucose in the blood. The normal production of insulin allows muscles and other
        tissue within the body to take glucose from the blood and convert it into energy. Administering
        insulin to a diabetic does not cure the Diabetes. However, it does make living with the disease a lot
        more manageable in the long term. Before the discovery of insulin in the early in the 20th century,
        Diabetes was a greatly feared disease with diabetics quickly succumbing to their death without
        even the slightest hope of prolonged survival.
        There are two distinct types of Diabetes, along with Gestational Diabetes. Pre-diabetes is the
        term given to the condition in people with high glucose levels that are not high enough to indicate
        Diabetes.</p><br>
        <h2> Type 1</h2>
        <p>Often referred to as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes describes the condition
        where the body does not produce insulin. It is mostly seen in children and young adults. Type1
        Diabetes accounts for about 5% to 10% of all diagnosed cases of Diabetes.</p><br>
        <h2> Type 2</h2>
        <p>In Type 2 Diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin for proper everyday functioning
        or the cells do not react properly to the insulin. Type2 Diabetes is the most common variety of
        diabetes in the world as it accounts for about 90%-95% of all types of diabetes.</p><br>
        <h2> Gestational Diabetes</h2>
            <p>This occurs in about 2%-10% of all pregnancies making it one of the most common health problems
        associated with pregnancy. When a woman is pregnant the hormonal changes occurring
        within the body can make the cells less responsive to insulin. In most cases it disappears when
        the pregnancy is over, with a small percentage of woman eventually being diagnosed with Type 2
        Diabetes after the pregnancy period. It shares many similarities to Type 2 Diabetes.</p>

                Expert Systems are a subset of Artificial Intelligence. The aim of an Expert System is to encapsulate the knowledge of a human expert inside a computer. The Expert System developed in this project focuses on Diabetes, an Expert in Diabetes is known as an Endocronologist. Our expert was a family Doctor based in Pretoria, Dr Aluwani Ndwambi. 
                This Expert System aims to closely imitate the interaction
                a patient would have with a Doctor during a converstation. A strict process of Knowledge Engineering was followed to acquire the necessary information. In order to achieve this a Doctor was worked with throughout the development phase of the application, other supplementary information was gathered from reputable online sources. The Expert System offers two facilities to the user, a Diabetes Risk Assessment and Diabetes Information facility. 

                 The Diabetes Risk Assessment focuses on the following 3 areas with the patient: 
                                <ul>
                <li>Demography and general information.</li>
                <li>Symptoms experienced by the user.</li>
                <li>Lifestyle of the patient.</li> 
                <ul>
                <br>
            Throghout the Assessment the Expert System offers comprehensive feedback to the user as well as a Diabetes Risk percentage, with the aim of indiccating to the user what their Diabetes risk is. The percentage calculation was not based on any medical guidelines as none were available for this
            purpose. However, it serves to demonstrate how a quantitative risk evaluation can be incorporated
            into the system. The Diabetes Information facility offers users with comprehensive definitions of the core concepts associated with Diabetes. This is to    riskaise      awareness and education on Diabetes to the general public.
            </P> <br>
            <h2>User testing and Evaluation</h2>
            <p>In order to test the feasiblity and usefulness of the Expert System we did extensive user tests throughout the project. We used a RAD (Rapid Application Development) approach to the development of the Expter System application. This meant that we had high user involvement throughout the development process and had a high prioroty on functional software at all times. The users gave us valuable feedback and suggestions for further improvement of the application. Unfortunaltey we could not test the system on less literate users because of the short time period of the project. We had 3 seperate iterations of user testing, making improvements to the application after each iteration. Different approaches to testing were implemented, with different groups of users. This was to ensure that we received as much good quality feedback as possible through trying different approaches. We made use of a qualified Doctor, UCT medical students and non-medial UCT students.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>A lot of positive feedback was received during the final round of user testing. All of of the users positively rating the Expert System above average as  well as stating that this Expert System has the potential to impact South Africa and raise Diabetes Awareness. The users stated that this system would not be easily understood by a user with only basic computer skills, this aspect of the system will need to be improved in future work.

            <p>
            This Expert System had two main components to it:
</p>
            <ol>
                <li> The User Interface</li>
                <li>The Expert System</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <br>
            These two components communicate to eachother through a servlet that relays data between the two, known in the MVC paradigm as a 'Controller'. This web-application is based on the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat server</a>, which allowed us to easily integrate <a href="http://www.jessrules.com/jess/index.shtml">JESS</a>(Java Expert System Shell) and Java to build the back end of the system.

<h2>Data Transfer</h2>
<p>
With the way the application was developed, the interface has no fore-knowledge of the content of the Expert System. Providing a high level of modularity. Throghout the Diabetes Risk Assessment, the Expert System sends all the data to the interface in JSON format, this is displayed by the interface appropriately. The answer from the users is then sent back to the Expert System in the backend and the interface waits for the next set of data to display. This method of data ehchange dictates the control flow of the application.

<br>
</p>
<p>
With this architecture, changes can be made to either the interface or the Expert System seperately, this low coupling approach allows for the ame interface to be used with a different Expert System, aslong as the correct API commands are used.
